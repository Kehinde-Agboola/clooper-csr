            <p>To help end homelessness and extreme poverty, the team at Clooper selected four charities closely aligned with our
            purpose statement. Clooper's founder Toks has previously volunteered for Shelter to feed the homeless in North Finchley,
            whilst our co-founder Matt selected The Passage at the request of his 6-year old daughter, who chose the charity to
            donate to for her annual “Christmas Lights Display".</p>
